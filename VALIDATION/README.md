# Classifier Validation Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts for validating classifier models using different approaches: ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and LUT (Look-Up Table).

## validation_classifier_ann.py

### Description
The `validation_classifier_ann.py` script performs validation using a regression ANN model. It generates multiple CSV files with predictions for each iteration.

### Usage
1. Adjust the file paths and model names in the script to match your dataset and model configurations.
2. Run the script to perform validation and generate prediction files.

## validation_classifier_LUT.py

### Description
The `validation_classifier_LUT.py` script uses a look-up table approach to find rows in the dataset closest to specified rows based on Manhattan distance. It then generates multiple CSV files with predictions for each iteration.

### Usage
1. Adjust the file paths and model names in the script to match your dataset and model configurations.
2. Run the script to perform validation and generate prediction files.


### Description
The `{modulator}_Validation.m` files are used to read the CSV files generated by the scripts above. They extract "real" specifications from simulations based on the generated predictions.

### Usage
1. Use these MATLAB scripts to process the generated CSV files and obtain real specifications from simulations.
2. Adjust file paths and names as needed to match your dataset and validation process.

## VAL-DS Folder

### Description
The `VAL-DS` folder contains `.mat` files that store both the desired specifications and the obtained specifications from the validation process. These files can later be used to generate statistics and analyze the performance of the classifier models.
